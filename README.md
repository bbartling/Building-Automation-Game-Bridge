# Building-Automation-Game-Bridge
Building Automation and Video Game Integration for HVAC Optimization

This project aims to bridge the gap between building automation systems and video game technology to optimize HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems in commercial buildings. By leveraging BACnet communication protocols and innovative game-inspired approaches, the project enables real-time monitoring, control, and optimization of VAV (Variable Air Volume) boxes. The solution combines concepts from mechanical engineering, controls automation, and game development to enhance energy efficiency, occupant comfort, and overall building performance. Join us in exploring the unexpected synergies between building automation and gaming, driving innovation in HVAC optimization and pushing the boundaries of interdisciplinary collaboration.
