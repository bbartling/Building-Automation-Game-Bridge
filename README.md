# Building-Automation-Game-Bridge
Building Automation and Video Game Integration for HVAC Optimization with a bot

This project aims to bridge the gap between building automation systems and video game technology to optimize HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems in commercial buildings. By leveraging BACnet communication protocols and innovative game-inspired approaches, the project enables real-time monitoring, control, and optimization of VAV (Variable Air Volume) boxes. The solution combines concepts from mechanical engineering, controls automation, and game development to enhance energy efficiency, occupant comfort, and overall building performance. Join us in exploring the unexpected synergies between building automation and gaming, driving innovation in HVAC optimization and pushing the boundaries of interdisciplinary collaboration.

## Remote Command and Control Server: 
Develop a secure remote command and control server that controls the bots actions which is operating autonomously behind the building's firewall. This server would enable efficient monitoring and control of the bot, including the ability to implement a kill switch if necessary. By ensuring the bot's operations can be managed remotely, it enhances the overall security and control of the system. C&C server to incorporate an OpenADR client feature to incorporate demand response control signals to the bot.

## Building Electrical Usage Optimization: 
Expand the capabilities of the bot to optimize electrical usage within the building. This includes implementing strategies such as electrical load shedding, load shifting, and continuous load management. The bot will autonomously analyze energy consumption patterns and make adjustments based on predefined optimization algorithms. Integration with the remote command and control server allows for real-time monitoring and fine-tuning of the electrical system.

## System-Level HVAC Optimization: 
Extend the bot's capabilities to optimize the HVAC system at a system-level. This involves focusing on areas such as trim respond AHU (Air Handling Unit) fan duct pressure control, leaving temperature setpoint optimization, as well as chiller and boiler plant management. By utilizing advanced algorithms and real-time data analysis, the bot can optimize the HVAC system's performance, energy efficiency, and occupant comfort.

## Integration of Other Building Systems: 
Expand the scope of the bot to integrate and manage other building systems beyond HVAC. This includes adjustable electrical loads such as lighting systems, battery storage systems, and ice storage systems. By incorporating these systems into the bot's control and optimization algorithms, it can create a holistic approach to energy management, maximizing efficiency, and reducing overall energy consumption.
